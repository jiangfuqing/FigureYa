## 需求描述

根据相关系数排列的无聚类热图，展示和TIM-3基因表达（某一连续变量）相关的免疫基因（其他连续变量）在样本中的分布情况。使用TCGA GBM数据以及例文给出的基因集，复现原图。

## Requirement description

Display the distribution of immune genes (other continuous variables) related to TIM-3 gene expression (a certain continuous variable) in the sample using a non clustered heatmap arranged according to the correlation coefficient. Using TCGA GBM data and the gene set provided in the example text, reproduce the original image.

Figure 3. (C, D) Most immune response related genes were significantly positively correlated with TIM-3 expression, while there were still a small number of genes were significantly negatively correlated with Tim-3 expression.

## 应用场景

展示跟某一个基因呈正/负相关的多个基因的表达模式。

例如像例文这种，每列一个样本，每行一个基因。上半部分画出与目标基因的表达模式呈正相关的免疫相关基因，下半部分是负相关的。顶部展示样本的亚组、基因型或其他临床信息。

## Application scenarios

Display the expression patterns of multiple genes that are positively/negatively correlated with a certain gene.

For example, in the example text, there is one sample per column and one gene per row. The upper part shows immune related genes that are positively correlated with the expression pattern of the target gene, while the lower part shows a negative correlation. Display the subgroups, genotypes, or other clinical information of the sample at the top.
