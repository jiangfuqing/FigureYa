Figure 2. Ranger provides variable importance score (VIS) for each CpG probe for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients only in the discovery phase and the validation phase. "Out of bag (OOB)" error rate of top CpG probes in the model, when probes were included one by one based on their VIS ranks in the discovery (A) and the validation phase (B).
