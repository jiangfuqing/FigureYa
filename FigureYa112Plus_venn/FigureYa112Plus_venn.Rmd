# 需求描述

vennyhttp://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/，新出来个选项，颜色填充by%。

缺点：只能填充灰色，只能保存成png。

我想要彩色，我想要pdf矢量图。

众筹FigureYa112venn时还没有R包能直接实现这样按百分比填充颜色的效果，于是FigureYa112venn的作者李誉辉综合了VennDiagram和colorfulVennPlot等R包，实现了想要的效果。

后来高春辉写了R包ggVennDiagram，方便好用，下面就展示一下用这个R包画venn图的用法。

输入基因列表，画出按百分比填充颜色的venn图，并输出各个区域的基因名。

# Requirement description

vennyhttp://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/ A new option has emerged, color filling by%.

Disadvantage: It can only be filled in gray and can only be saved as PNG.

I want color, I want PDF vector graphics.

When crowdfunding FigureYa112venn, there was no R package that could directly achieve the effect of filling colors by percentage. Therefore, the author of FigureYa112venn, Li Yuhui, integrated R packages such as VennDiagram and colorfulVennPlot to achieve the desired effect.

Later, Gao Chunhui wrote the R package ggVennDiagram, which is convenient and easy to use. Below is a demonstration of how to use this R package to draw Venn diagrams.

Input the gene list, draw a Venn chart filled with colors by percentage, and output the gene names for each region.

# 应用场景

展示重叠关系，例如多个分组之间共有的、特异的差异表达基因。

适用于2、3或4个list的overlap，超过4个用upsetR更合适。

# Application scenarios

Display overlapping relationships, such as shared and specific differentially expressed genes between multiple groups.

Suitable for overlaps of 2, 3, or 4 lists, with upsetR being more appropriate for more than 4 lists.
