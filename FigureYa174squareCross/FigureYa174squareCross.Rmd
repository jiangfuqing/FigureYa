# 需求描述

# Requirement

这篇文章自带的R代码里没找到这张图的代码……
I couldn't find the code for this graph in the R code provided with this article...

我其实就想要基因表达和药物连线，他右侧target 和pathway的连线。
Actually, I just want the connection between gene expression and drugs, the connection on the right side of the target and pathway.

感觉用的地方其实挺多的，想学学连线的方法。
It seems that there are actually quite a few places where it can be used. I want to learn the method of connecting lines.

Fig. 5 | Effects of multidimensional hypoxia-associated signatures on drug response. a, Interaction of hypoxia-associated mRNAs, DNA methylation, miRNAs and drug response. Upregulated genes (red bars in upper panel) in hypoxia score-high ESCA negatively correlate (green lines, drug-sensitive) with the response to 17 drugs. Downregulated miRNAs (blue bars, left panel), hypomethylation (blue bars, bottom panel) for the corresponding upregulated genes positively correlate (magenta lines, drug-resistant) to drug response. The target genes and targeted pathways of drugs are listed in the panel to the right. The gold line indicates miRNA-targeted mRNAs; the red line links the drug to its target and targeted pathway. DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; Hsp90, heat shock protein 90; KIF11, kinesin family member 11; PRKC, serine/threonine-protein kinase; SHP-1/2, Src homology 2 domain- containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1/2; STLC, S-trityl-l-cysteine.

# 应用场景

# Application Scenarios

任意两组、多组连线。
Connect any two or more groups.

多列或上下左右的排布方式。
Multi-column or up-down, left-right arrangement.

根据自己数据的生物学意义，来排列各个节点的顺序。或许能够出现特殊的模式，从而展示出有意义的生物学规律。
Arrange the order of each node based on the biological significance of your own data. Perhaps special patterns can emerge, thereby revealing meaningful biological laws.
