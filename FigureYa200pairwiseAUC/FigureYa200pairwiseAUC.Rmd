# 需求描述

我想众筹Figure 1B，两个数据集里面看预后判断力都很好的基因。

# Requirement Description

I want to crowdfund Figure 1B, and look at the genes with good prognostic judgment in both datasets.

FIg. 1. PDLIM1 is down-regulated in human metastatic HCC tissues. (A) Heat map showing 402 genes differentially expressed in HCC tissues with or without metastasis based on data set **GSE364**. (B) area under the curve evaluation of the prognostic value of candidate genes involved in metastasis-related events based on data sets **TCGA and GSE10816**. Those genes with no detectable protein expression in liver cancer were excluded and are colored in **gray**.

# 应用场景

训练集定义候选基因，后在两个测试集里寻找预后判断力都好的基因集合。

# Application Scenarios

The training set defines the candidate genes, and then looks for the set of genes with good prognostic judgment in both test sets.
