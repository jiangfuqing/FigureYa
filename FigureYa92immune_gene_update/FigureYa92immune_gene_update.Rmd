当初众筹是因为果子的idea，用这种方式展示两个转录本和免疫浸润的关系，发布在果子学生信公众号上<https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/tWJkLVDt1mx5COduw7H35w>。小伙伴看到了也想画，我们就众筹了。后来有小伙伴用这个图发表了文章，供参考：

The original crowdfunding was due to the idea of Guozi, which showed the relationship between the two transcripts and immune infiltration in this way, and was published on the official account of Guozi Student Letter< https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/tWJkLVDt1mx5COduw7H35w >The friends also wanted to draw when they saw it, so we crowdfunded. Later, a friend published an article using this image for reference:

# 应用场景

评价基因对免疫浸润的影响，甚至可以写成循环，批量筛选出影响免疫浸润的候选基因。

不仅限于基因跟免疫浸润之间的关系，还可以把免疫细胞矩阵替换为基因表达矩阵，计算基因跟基因之间的关系，找出并可视化共表达基因；或者把基因表达矩阵替换为转录本或临床信息，用于分析不同转录本、甚至临床指标跟免疫浸润的关系。

在“小丫画图”公众号回复“R2”查看类似的图在文章里的用法。

# Application scenarios

Evaluate the impact of genes on immune infiltration, and even write it as a cycle to batch screen candidate genes that affect immune infiltration.

Not limited to the relationship between genes and immune infiltration, the immune cell matrix can also be replaced with a gene expression matrix to calculate the relationship between genes and identify and visualize co expressed genes; Alternatively, the gene expression matrix can be replaced with transcripts or clinical information to analyze the relationship between different transcripts, even clinical indicators, and immune infiltration.
