Figure 1 Strategy for identifying tumor-infiltrating immune-related lncRNA signature (TILSig) in this study. Top 5% expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were obtained as candidate immune-related lncRNAs for each immune cell line. The specificity of expression of a candidate immune-related lncRNA with respect to different immune cell types was calculated using tissue specificity index (TSI). Those housekeeping lncRNAs (hklncRNAs) which are upregulated in immune cell lines and downregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines were selected as tumor-infiltrating immune-related lncRNAs.

A prognostic signature by focusing tumor-infiltrating immune-related lncRNAs (TILSig) was constructed using the linear combination of the expression values of the prognostic tumor-infiltrating immune-related lncRNAs, weighted by their estimated regression coefficients in the multivariate Cox regression analysis.
