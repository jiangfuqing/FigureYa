# 需求描述

小丫姐，想众筹下这个算法，利用CRISPR数据库，筛选出某种肿瘤细胞影响生长的基因，再结合TCGA数据库，对湿实验的指导意义非常大。谢谢啦

# Requirement Description

Sister Xiaoya, I want to crowdfund this algorithm, use the CRISPR database to screen out the genes that affect the growth of certain tumor cells, and then combine it with the TCGA database, which is of great significance for the guidance of wet experiments. Thank you

# 应用场景

癌症依赖关系图谱（简称DepMap）基于CRISPR screening技术，筛选出对数百种癌细胞生长必需的基因。例文进一步结合TCGA表达数据，给癌症做分子分型。

These findings may allow us to refine the preexisting subtype classification of LUAD, and also guide us in identifying tumors that may be vulnerable to specific treatments.

# Application Scenarios

The Cancer Dependency Atlas (DepMap) is based on CRISPR screening technology to screen out genes that are essential for the growth of hundreds of cancer cells. In this example, TCGA expression data is further combined to molecularly classify cancer.

These findings may allow us to refine the preexisting subtype classification of LUAD, and also guide us in identifying tumors that may be vulnerable to specific treatments.

Figure 1C correlation display can refer to our previous crowdfunded <https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/D9wheY5QdnOh4JrjIc8-Cg>, <https://k.koudai.com/Eig1YOB4>

Figure 1D can be found in Figure 1D for a presentation of the results of the candidate gene function enrichment assay, as shown in <https://k.koudai.com/sm2p0xYn>
