# 需求描述

时间序列数据，用STEM找出了profile，想用R画出文章里这样的图，右侧box plot要标出每两组之间的显著性。

# Requirement Description

Time series data, used STEM to find out the profile, want to use R to draw a plot like the one in the article, the right hand side box plot should be labeled with the significance between each of the two groups.

Figure 3. Time-resolved analysis of transcript levels of genes containing EBF1-occupied sites within ±25 kb of transcription start sites before and after EBF1 induction (A,B). Up-regulated and down-regulated genes that change transcript levels >10-fold between 0 h and the pro-B stage are shown in A and B, respectively. Genes that are regulated by twofold to 10-fold are shown in Supplemental Figure S4, A and B. Individual transcript levels are shown in Supplemental Table S1 (>10-fold changes) and Supplemental Table S2 (twofold to 10-fold changes). Genes are organized into different clusters based on expression pattern using Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM) (Ernst and Bar-Joseph 2006). Line plots (left panels) and box plots (right panels) are used to show fold changes (log2 scale) and absolute expression levels (log2 scale), respectively. Representative genes of each cluster are listed at the right. In each line plot, one representative gene is highlighted in red. (FC) Fold change; (FPKM) fragments per kilobase per million reads.

# 应用场景

多个时间点的时间序列数据，例如多个发育时期、处理后多个时间点取样，用STEM找到profile后，同时展示基因表达变化趋势以及基因表达量的分布。

STEM的用法和参数设置不是这里要讨论的内容，使用前请查看STEM软件自带的STEMmanual.pdf。

# Application scenarios

Time series data from multiple time points, such as multiple developmental stages and samples taken at multiple time points after processing, can be analyzed using STEM to find the profile and display the trend of gene expression changes and the distribution of gene expression levels.

The usage and parameter settings of STEM are not the topics to be discussed here. Please refer to the STEMmanual. pdf provided with the STEM software before use.
