## 需求描述

用TCGA数据画这种图，在不同分期对比不同分型里某个基因的表达量。从数据下载到出图。

## Requirement description

Draw this graph using TCGA data to compare the expression level of a certain gene in different stages and subtypes. Download data to generate images.

Figure 2. PD-L1 expression in molecular subtypes (A, B)

To investigate the molecular relevance between PD-L1 and glioma, we asked the distribution of PD-L1 expression in different molecular subtypes defined by TCGA network. As shown in Figs. 2A and B PD-L1 was significantly upregulated in mesenchymal subtype than other subtypes in both CGGA and TCGA dataset, except for classical subtype in CGGA data set, which also showed apparent trend although not significant. This result enlightened us that PD-L1 may serve as a biomarker for mesenchymal subtype.

## 应用场景

基因在哪个分期能区分不同亚型？画这个图一目了然。

然后还可以像例文那样接着画ROC曲线，画法可参考FigureYa24ROC。

甚至你可以写成循环，批量画出多个基因，看看哪几个基因的分型效果更好。

## Application scenarios

At which stage can genes distinguish different subtypes? Draw this picture at a glance.

Then you can continue to draw the ROC curve like in the example text, and the drawing method can refer to FigureYa24ROC.

You can even write it as a loop and draw multiple genes in batches to see which genes have better typing results.
